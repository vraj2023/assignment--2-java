/*(Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 2, the Account class was defined to model a bank account.
        An account has the properties account number, balance, annual interest rate, and date created,
        and methods to deposit and withdraw funds. Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts.
        A checking account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn. Draw the UML diagram for the
        classes and then implement them. Write a test program that
        creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.*/
